# Java-Projects

This repository utilizes the practical solutions of a thorough Java programming course. I explored the fundamental programming concepts during the course, gaining proficiency in Eclipse, the primary Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java development. I learned important programming techniques like selections, loops, and data structure manipulation, with an emphasis on arrays. examining advanced topics such as exception handling and graphical user interface  programming enriched my skill set even further. The course also gave me a firm grasp on object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Overall, I obtained experience running, testing, and debugging Java programs, laying the groundwork for future data and analytics applications.
